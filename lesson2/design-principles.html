                <p>
                    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
                    avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
                    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful."

                    <h2>CONTRAST</h2>
                    <p>Contrast is one of the most effective ways to add visual interest to your page and to create an organizational hierarchy among different elements. For contrast to be effective, however, it must be strong. Don’t be a wimp.</P>

                        The Principle of Contrast states: Contrast various elements of the piece to draw a reader’s eye into the page. If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different.

Really different. Contrast not only serves to draw in the eye, but you can use it to organize information, clarify the hierarchy, guide a reader around the page, and provide focus.</p>

                    <h2>PROXIMITY</h2>
                    <p>Words, phrases, and graphics are often strung out all over the place and taking up lots of room so there won’t be any empty space. When pieces of a design are scattered all over, the page appears unorganized and the information may not be instantly accessible to the reader.</P>
                        <P>The Principle of Proximity states: Group related items together. Move them physically close to each other so the related items are seen as one cohesive group rather than a bunch of unrelated bits. Items or groups of information that are not related to each other should not be in close proximity.

                    <h2>ALIGNMENT</h2>
                    <p>New designers tend to put text and graphics on the page wherever there happens to be space, often without regard to any other items on the page. It doesn’t take much to clean up the slightly messy kitchen, just as it doesn’t take much to clean up a slighty messy design that has weak alignments.</P>
                        <P>The Principle of Alignment states: Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page. The principle of alignment forces you to be conscious—no longer can you just throw things on the page.
