            <h2>My Typography</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Typography is so much more than just choosing beautiful fonts: it's a vital
                component of user interface design. Good typography will establish a strong visual hierarchy, provide a
                graphic balance to the website, and set the product's overall tone.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">It tells the consumer what they're reading and why it's important
                to them. Typography influences how readers process information, and the most successful typography also
                engages the consumer.

            <p style="text-align: justify;"> The new Ubuntu Font Family was started to enable the personality of Ubuntu to be seen and felt in every
                menu, button and dialog. The typeface is sans-serif, uses OpenType features and is manually hinted for
                clarity on desktop and mobile computing screens.

            <!-- change this -->
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz
                Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in Polish). ... In the last ten or so years, during which Łukasz has
                been designing type, most of his projects were rooted in a particular design task that he needed to
                solve.

            <p class="p" style="text-align: justify;">
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                Colored paragraph example
            </h2>
            <p class="p" style="text-align: justify;">
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
