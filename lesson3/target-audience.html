            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Your target audience refers to the specific group of consumers most likely
                to want your product or service, and therefore, the group of people who should see your ad campaigns.
                Target audience may be dictated by age, gender, income, location, interests or a myriad of other
                factors.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Target audiences can also be formed from different groups, for example: adults, teens, children,
                mid-teens,
                preschoolers, men, or women. To market to any given audience effectively, it is essential to become
                familiar with your target market; their habits, behaviors, likes, and dislikes.
