            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Since
                outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to
                plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.
            </p>

                    conditions
                    which will enhance societal benefits, including protection of life and property,
                    public health and safety, and to support economic prosperity as well as the quality of life for the
                    Preston,
                    Soda spring and Fish Haven communities.</P>

            <h2>Domain Name</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The domain for the CWC weeather site is "www.cloud10.news" based on availability search conducted on
                whois.com domain services. The .news is an active TLD in ICANN's New gTLD Program. It is currently sold
                for $25 but I will take advantage of WHOIS.COM on-going promo to buy it at $5.88.
